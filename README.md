# 📊 Automated Sales Analysis System
### Python · SQLite · Tableau · Scikit-learn

> **Business Question:** *Which customer segment and region combination is most profitable — and are discounts actually growing revenue or silently destroying margins?*

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

| Finding | Detail |
|---|---|
| 💀 Discount Killer | Orders with **50% discount** generate **negative profit margins** on average |
| ✅ Sweet Spot | **0–10% discount** orders sustain **40–45% profit margins** |
| 🏆 Top Segment | **Home Office (North)** and **Consumer** segments show highest margin % |
| 🎯 ML Segments | K-Means identified 3 distinct customer types: **High Value**, **Regular**, **Margin Killers** |

## ⚙️ Pipeline Flow

```
raw_sales.csv
      │
      ▼
 cleaning.py        → Standardizes columns, parses dates, scrubs currency,
                       caps outliers, engineers Profit & Profit_Margin
      │
      ▼
 setup_sql.py       → Loads cleaned_data.csv into SQLite (sales_data.db)
      │
      ▼
 analysis.py        → SQL GROUP BY queries: segment profitability,
                       discount impact → exports to /outputs
      │
      ▼
 segmentation.py    → K-Means (k=3) with StandardScaler on Revenue +
                       Profit_Margin → dynamic cluster labeling → PNG export
```

**Run the entire pipeline with one command:**
```bash
python automate.py
```

## 🐛 Real-World Bugs Resolved

These are actual errors encountered and fixed during development — not a tutorial run-through:

| Error | Root Cause | Fix Applied |
|---|---|---|
| `UnicodeDecodeError` | Kaggle CSV had special characters | Switched `pd.read_csv` encoding to `latin1` |
| `TypeError` on math ops | Financial columns imported as strings (contained `$`, `,`) | Wrote custom scrubber to strip symbols → `pd.to_numeric` |
| `KeyError: 'customer_id'` | Kaggle uses `customer_name`, not `customer_id` | Debugged with `df.columns.tolist()`, updated script |
| `FileNotFoundError` | Relative paths broke when running from different directories | Upgraded all paths to absolute using `os.path.abspath(__file__)` |
| `PermissionError` | CSV was open in Excel (Windows file lock) | Closed Excel before running script |

## 📈 ML Segmentation — How It Works

The K-Means model clusters customers along two axes:
- **Revenue** (total order value)
- **Profit_Margin** (profitability ratio)

Data is standardized with `StandardScaler` before clustering so large revenue values don't dominate the margin signal.

Cluster labels are **dynamically assigned** — not hardcoded. After fitting, centroids are ranked by mean profit, and labels (`High Value`, `Regular`, `Margin Killers`) are mapped programmatically. This means the script adapts correctly to any new dataset.

## 🚀 How to Run

**1. Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/khushijangid367/sales-analysis-project
cd sales-analysis-project
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

**3. Add the dataset**

Download the [Kaggle Superstore dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final) and place it at:
```
data/raw_sales.csv
```

**4. Run the full pipeline**
```bash
python automate.py
```

Outputs will appear in the `/outputs` folder.
